# Suppose you have a list of 128 names, and you're searching through it using binary search. 
# What's the maximum number of steps it would take?

# Step 1: Write it as: log 2 128
# Step 2: How many 2's would we multiply to get to 128?
# Step 3: 128 / 2 = 64, 64 / 2 = 32, 32 / 2 = 16, 16 / 2 = 8, 8 / 2 = 4, 4 / 2 = 2, 2 / 2 = 1
# Step 4: Count how many times we divided 128 by 2 to get to 1. 7 times. 
# Step 5: Maximum number of steps it would take is 7.
